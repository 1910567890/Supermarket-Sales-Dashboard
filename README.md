# Supermarket-Sales-Dashboard
This challenge aimed to create a high-level KPI Dashboard for the Supermarket team, using a subset of Sales records. The report provides stakeholders with insights into the Supermarket's recent performance and addresses key questions such as: 
1. What is the most popular sales product line?
2. What is the gross income per month?
3. What is the total cost and the total sales?
4. which city has big sales?


Data Preparation: I imported the dataset into Power Query for some thorough cleaning. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, changing data types, filtering rows, and getting rid of unwanted columns.

Analysis: I created various DAX formulas and measures to crunch the numbers and uncover insights.

Visualization: I brought everything together in Power BI for a detailed analysis
